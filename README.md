# Sorting-Algorithms
Write a program that has an array of at least 20 integers (2, 34, 15, 29, 1, 10â€¦.).  It should call a function to sort the values of the original array in ascending order using the selection sort algorithm.  Give a description of Big-O for this algorithm in the output screen.  Next, using the same sorted array values, call another function that uses the linear search algorithm to locate one of the values in the array sorted array (any value).  Give a brief description of Big-O for this algorithm in the output screen.  The algorithm should keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes until it finds the value.  Lastly, using the same sorted array (from selection sort), call the binary search algorithm to locate a different value in the array.  Give a brief description of Big-O for this algorithm in the output screen.  Again, the algorithm should keep a count of the number of comparisons it makes until it finds the value.
